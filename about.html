    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Keylin Mella. I’m currently a 6th-semester Communication Design student with a vision that blends graphic design, interior design, and real estate. My work showcases a wide range of creative approaches and reflects my personal growth through each class and project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in design that creates experience — whether it’s through a powerful layout, a visual environment, or a branding message. I want this portfolio to serve as a reflection of who I am creatively and the direction I’m headed professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not designing, I’m exploring spaces, sketching ideas, or learning more about how design connects with architecture, business, and community.
