    <p>
      My name is Keylin Mella, and I’m currently a 6th-semester Communication Design student with a creative vision that blends interior design, graphic design, and real estate. I use my education and experiences to explore how visual design can shape emotions, spaces, and stories.

      This portfolio showcases my growth and versatility as a designer, with work spanning typography, architecture, branding, and spatial composition. Each project reflects my desire to connect creativity with purpose — whether through a conceptual poster or an urban connector design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside the classroom, I’m constantly observing how people move through and respond to visual environments. That curiosity fuels everything I make — from editorial layouts to digital spaces — and drives me to keep pushing my creative boundaries.
